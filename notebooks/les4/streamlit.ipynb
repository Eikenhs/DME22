    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling a business user to interact with the data and the outcomes of a project is often very important. With `streamlit` you can easily create web apps that allow your client to interact with the data without having to deal with the details and complexities of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication is key\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication is a key part of data mining & exploration. In the business understanding phase, communication is essential to get a profound understanding of the client's problem and to define the objective and data mining goals of the project. In later phases, it is essential to translate the outcome of the project to the client and the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication is more than mere visualization\n",
    "Good communication of the outcomes of an analysis often requires well thought out and balanced data visualization. However, how effective and attractive they may be, showing only charts and visuals in a slide deck is not always sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, clients needs to be able to interact with the data (e.g. slice, filter, zoom etc.) in a dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "With packages like `streamlit` it is relatively easy to build a web app or dashboard that allow a user to interact with the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many projects, this ability can make or break the adoption of the project outcomes."

    "\n",
    "There are many options for web app frameworks in Python. Rather simple (e.g. [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) for dashboards or [Flet](https://flet.dev/) for more general purpose web apps) and more sophisticated/flexible frameworks (e.g. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)).\n",

    "```\n",
    "$ poetry add streamlit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note!\n",
    "`streamlit` is not compatible with Python 3.9.7. Even, if you don't have that exact version installed, the installation may fail because your `pyproject.toml` may be too permissive for the Python version. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, modify your `pyproject.toml` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[tool.poetry.dependencies]\n",
    "python = \">=3.9,<3.9.7 || >3.9.7,<3.10\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line allows all Python versions between 3.9 and 3.10 except 3.9.7. Alternatively, you could fix the Python version that `poetry` uses to a specific version (other than 3.9.7)."

    "# How a web app works\n",
    "\n",
    "A web app works in a client server architecture, which is a bit different from a normal command line app. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It starts with running a web server. This web server is an app that continuously listens to a port on your computer and waits for a request from a web browser.\n",
    "- If the web server receives a request, it processes the request and returns an HTML page in response.\n",
    "- The web browser receives the response, renders the HTML and shows the result in your web browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A minor complication when working remote\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work remote (as we do on virtual machines), there is a minor complication. The web server that runs on your virtual machine cannot be reached directly from the outside world. We have to manually set up a connection from the ports of our local pc to the ports of the virtual machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Visual Studio Code provides functionality for this so-called port mapping (i.e. connecting a remote to a local port) and it only requires a simple additional step. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Ports panel, we have to configure a port forwarding. Once this has been done, we can submit requests in our local browser to the webserver on the (remote) virtual machine and we can receive responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to configure port forwarding in Visual Studio Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the `PORTS` tab in the lower panel of the screen\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ![port_forwarding_01](img/port_forwarding_01.png)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Click on `Forward a Port`\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Enter the port number and press `<Enter>`. The port number is typically `8501` for `streamlit`, but it may be different in your case. You can find the port number the URL (after the `:`) that is shown when you run `streamlit`.\n",
